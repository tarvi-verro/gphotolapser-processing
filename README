This is a repository for processing the sequence of images produced by
gphotolapser into a sequence of images that produce a smooth movie.

The problems that this tool aims to address are as follows:

 - Blend together any extra images captured per cycle (see extras_per_cycle).
 - Highlight any missing frames.
 - Extrapolate to target luminance to smooth out flickering.

Compiling
=========

First grab the Haskell compiler ghc from your distribution, after which
producing the executable should be as simple as running:

	$ make

in the gphotolapser-processing directory.

Additionally, the programs exiv2 and imagemagick are needed to execute the
processing recipe.

Usage
=====

The gphotolapser-processing program's functionality is limited to reading the
exiv data from the images in the sequence and prints out a list of shell
commands, a recipe if you will, that will produce the desired image series.

A typical use case looks as follows:

	$ cd timelapse-images
	$ .../gph-process > process.sh
	$ mkdir out
	$ sh process.sh
